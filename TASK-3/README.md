# Task 3 – To-Do List Application 

##  Description

This task involved building a **To-Do List Web Application** with full **CRUD** functionality . It allows users to create, edit, delete, and track their daily tasks efficiently, with a user interface that matches a modern purple-themed calendar style.

##  Files Included

- `index.html` or `todo.html` – Main file containing the to-do list layout and functionality
- `style.css` – Custom styles (if separated)
- `script.js` – JavaScript to handle dynamic interactions like adding/removing tasks, setting alarms (if applicable)



##  Features

-  Add new tasks with descriptions and time
-  Edit existing tasks
-  Delete tasks individually
-  Mark tasks as completed
-  (Optional) Alarm or notification for scheduled tasks
-  Purple-themed calendar-inspired design
-  Responsive layout for desktop and mobile use

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling (custom or Tailwind-based)
- JavaScript for interactivity and alarms
- LocalStorage (optional) to save tasks between sessions

##  How It Works

1. User types a task and submits it.
2. Task appears in a list with options to mark done, edit, or delete.
3. If an alarm is set, a sound or visual alert notifies the user.
4. All actions update the task list dynamically without page reload.

##  Learning Outcome

This project demonstrates how to:
- Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM
- Implement core CRUD operations in a web app
- Apply clean and responsive styling
- Optionally use browser notifications or timers

##  Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

- Add task categories (e.g., Work, Study, Personal)
- Integrate with calendar or notification API
- Save tasks using browser LocalStorage or Firebase
